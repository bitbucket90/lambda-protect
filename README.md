# lambda-protect
Automatic GitHub webhook that adds branch protection and notification of a new branch using Lambda and API Gateway

Built off the original https://github.com/zkoppert/Auto-branch-protect and the great work done by https://github.com/learnazcloud/Auto-branch-protect I decided to clean it up and make it serverless, using just two services, lambda and api gateway. This is a low cost, easy to utilize webhook to manage your organizations GitHub security needs.
